\section*{About This Tutorial}
 This tutorial demonstrates basic set-up and design methods available in the web version (\url{kraken.cse.unsw.edu.au:11137}) 
of ARGUS. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a greater understanding of how to
implement and emulate your own processor-based hardware/software system on FPGA using the ARGUS web.

\subsection*{Additional Resources}
To find the way to use git, see the online tutorial of git at:\newline

\section{Getting Started}

\subsection{Software Requirements}
Operating system, web browser, git are required.

\subsection{Hardware Requiremnets}
None.

\subsection{Setting up ARGUS-Software}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fork the ARGUS-software repository on github at \url{https://github.com/unsw-cse-esl/argus-software}.
\item Clone your repository. Use git command:\\ 
\texttt{git clone \url{git@github.com:[username]/argus-software.git}}
\item Add remote upstream. Use git command:\\
\texttt{git add upstream \url{https://github.com/unsw-cse-esl/argus-software.git}}
\item If you will run simulation at your local machine, set up environment variables for the architecture-specific GNU/GCC tools. These variable names are used in ARGUS-software's scripts for simulation. For example, for simplescalar, set \texttt{SSPATH=/home/foo/bar/pisa}, and
for Leon2/SPARC, set \texttt{L2PATH=/home/foo/bar/leon2}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Overview of ARGUS Design Flow}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/design-flow.eps}
\caption{Web-based ARGUS Design Flow}\label{fig-designflow}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-designflow} shows the basic design flow of using the web-based ARGUS design tool. After the setup of the repository, the user can make changes of the processor hardware or software at local repository. In order to create a FPGA emulation, the user needs to, firstly, \texttt{git commit} and \texttt{git push} the changes (local build) to the github. 

Then, by visiting the website of ARGUS, the user will be able to (1) synthesize the new hardware (ARGUS-hardware flow), and, (2) generate the software on top of the synthesized hardware (ARGUS-software flow). In the end of the software flow, the bitstream containing the entire hardware and software will be automatically transferred to the FPGA, which is connected to the ARGUS server. After the transfer, the FPGA will be automatically configured and emulating the system. The following sections will use an example to go through the entire web-based ARGUS design flow.

\section{Creating New ARGUS-Hardware Project}
\begin{figure}[tb]

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/login.eps}
\caption{Snapshot of authentication page of web ARGUS}\label{fig-login}
\end{figure}•

After ARGUS repository is set up in your machine, you can start to make your own modifications on the processor IPs provided by ARGUS and create the FPGA emulation containing the modified processor in ARGUS. Here we will go through an example ARGUS hardware project as the follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Commit and push your modified design to github.
\begin{verbatim}
git add [list of the source files]
git commit -m "description of the commit"
git push
\end{verbatim}•
\item Open ARGUS web GUI in your Internet browser at the address: \texttt{\url{kraken:11137}}. If it is your first time visiting ARGUS web, the authentication page, shown in Figure~\ref{fig-login}, will be seen. Enter your username (ask for username from administrator of ARGUS or Kraken server) in the prompt and click the ``Log in'' button.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/fork.eps}
\caption{Snapshot of adding new fork}\label{fig-fork}
\end{figure}•
\item As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-fork}, click on the ``Forks'' and then ``Refresh'' in web GUI to let ARGUS add your new github fork (created in Section~\ref{sec-ARGHW}) into the fork list. You might need to wait for a few minutes for this process to be finished.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/hwmain.eps}
\caption{Snapshot of ARGUS hardware main page}\label{fig-hwmain}
\end{figure}•
\item Click on the ``Hardware'' and you will see all the hardware projects (see Figure~\ref{fig-hwmain}), which are created by your username in ARGUS. If you would like to see the hardware projects from all the users in ARGUS, click on the ``all'' in the brackets after ``Hardware''. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/addhwtask.eps}
\caption{Snapshot of adding ARGUS hardware project}\label{fig-addhwtask}
\end{figure}•
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/addhwconfig.eps}
\caption{Snapshot of ARGUS hardware config}\label{fig-addhwconfig}
\end{figure}•
\item Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on ``Add new task'', and you will see the task specification page, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-addhwtask}. In this page, select your hardware branch, from the your own fork, which was inserted into ARGUS web at Step 3. Then, type your project name. You also need to fill in the ``Config'', which specifies your hardware. A part of example task config is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-addhwconfig}. If you are new to ARGUS, you can copy the existing config and customize on top of it. At last, click on the ``Add'' button at the leftbottom. 
\item After ``Add'', your new hardware task/project will be read by ARGUS backend and automatically passed to Xilinx ISE for synthesis. You can view the status of the major stages of the synthesis on ARGUS web (need to refresh the webpage by yourself, since ARGUS does not automatically update the status in the current version). If you click on the status in one stage, you can see the detailed runtime log from Xilinx ISE. After the synthesis is finished, the rightmost column (i.e., the last stage ``bit'') will show ``bit''. By clicking on the ``bit'', you can directly download the bitstream of your hardware.

\end{enumerate}•

\section{Creating New ARGUS-Software Project}
The first three steps of ARGUS-software flow is same as the ones in ARGUS-hardware flow. The following steps are elabrated as the follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Enter the ARGUS software project page by clicking on the ``Software''. Similar to hardware flow, you will see all the software projects created by your username.  If you would like to see the hardware projects from all the users in ARGUS, click on the ``all'' in the brackets after ``Software''.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/addswtask.eps}
\caption{Snapshot of adding ARGUS software project}\label{fig-addswtask}
\end{figure}•
\item Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on ``Add new task'', and you will see the task specification page, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-addswtask}. Note this page is different to the that of hardware flow. You will need to select both a ``Hardware'' and the ``Software branch''. Select the hardware that has been synthesized in hardware flow. Then, select your software branch, which is pushed from your local machine. Like the hardware flow, you also need to fill in the specification in ``Config''. The following is an example config for Leon2 processor, running ADPCM software.
\begin{verbatim}
[
	{
		"imem": "simple_imem_ctrl",
		"dmem": "simple_dmem_ctrl",
		"name": "simple_leon2",
		"target": "sparcv7w_pg",
		"options": {
			"NODE_NUM": "0"
		},
		"app": "adpcm1"
	}
]
\end{verbatim}•
\item Select ``Splitter''. There are two options, ``Byte'' and ``None'', which decides how the output of the FPGA emulation is shown in the ARGUS web. Usually, None is used. Next, select the timeout time in seconds, since the current version of ARGUS cannot automatically be aware of the completion of the emulation. When timeout is set to 30, ARGUS web will assume the emulation ends after 30 seconds. And, the output of the FPGA at the 30th second will be shown in the last column, which is emulation result. Baudrate is set to 115200. If you want to use ARGUS in interactive mode, you can tickle the box. In this case, the emulation output will not be shown in the ARGUS web. Instead, you will get the output stream at port 8081 of the server called buffalo. 
\item After you finished the previous step, click on the ``Add'' button at the leftbottom. ARGUS will read your task specification, compile the program, generate the system bitstream containing the selected hardware and memory content (i.e., your software build), configure the FPGA with the new bitstream, and collect the emulation output. 
\end{enumerate}•

\section{Porting New Processor IP into ARGUS}
Before creating new processor intellectual property (IP) in ARGUS, make sure the steps in Section~\ref{sec-ARGHW} have been done. The major steps are illustrated as the follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Enter argus-hardware directory at the local machine.
\begin{verbatim}
cd /path/to/directory/argus-hardware/pcores
\end{verbatim}
\item Create a new directory for your processor IP. In this example, we create a new Leon2 processor, called ``leon2\_v1\_00\_a''.
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir /path/to/directory/argus-hardware/pcores/leon2_v1_00_a
\end{verbatim}•
\item Create two sub-directories, ``data'' and ``hdl'', in the new directory that is just made. 
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir data; mkdir hdl
\end{verbatim}•
\item Suppose your source code is written in VHDL. Create a sub-directory, ``vhdl'', in ``hdl'' and copy your source code of processor IP into ``hdl/vhdl''.
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir hdl/vhdl
cp /path/to/directory/source/*.vhd /path/to/directory/argus-
hardware/pcores/leon2_1_00_a/hdl/vhdl
\end{verbatim}•
\item Go to ``leon2\_v1\_00\_a/data'' and create two new files, ``leon2\_v2\_1\_0.mpd'' and ``leon2\_v2\_1\_0.pao''. The ``.mpd'' file is microprocessor peripheral definition file used by Xilinx ISE, which defines the interface for the peripheral. It mainly includes: (1) ports and default connectivity for bus interfaces; and, (2) parameters and default values. The ``.pao'' file is peripheral analyze order file. It contains a list of Hardware Description Language (HDL) files that are needed for synthesis, and defines the analyze order for compilation. An example mpd file is shown below:
